# Learning JavaScript

Welcome to my journey of learning JavaScript! This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress as I learn and practice JavaScript. Here, you will find study materials, exercises, examples, and projects that I have worked on to improve my JavaScript skills. I will be updating this repository regularly as I cover new topics and complete new projects.

## Repository Structure

- `00-Introduction`: Basic concepts and environment setup. This section includes my initial notes and exercises on getting started with JavaScript.
- `01-Basic-Syntax`: Fundamentals of JavaScript syntax. Here, I will be exploring the basic building blocks of JavaScript.
- `02-DOM-Manipulation`: Working with the Document Object Model (DOM). This section will delve into manipulating web pages with JavaScript.
- `03-Advanced-JS`: Advanced JavaScript topics, including ES6 features, asynchronous programming, and JavaScript frameworks.
- `04-Projects`: Practical projects to apply what I've learned. As I complete more projects, I will add them here to showcase my skills.
- `resources`: Additional resources like books, video tutorials, and useful links. I will keep adding valuable resources that I find helpful in my learning journey.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jakxel12/Learning-javascript
    ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder and follow the instructions in each section.

## Development Progress

### 00-Introduction
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Contents:** Basic concepts about JavaScript, installation instructions, and environment setup.

### 01-Basic-Syntax
- **Status:** Planned
- **Contents:** Notes on variables, data types, control structures (if statements, loops), functions, and basic JavaScript concepts. Exercises and example scripts to practice syntax.

### 02-DOM-Manipulation
- **Status:** Planned
- **Contents:** This section will cover selecting and manipulating DOM elements, event handling, and creating dynamic content with JavaScript. I will add notes, exercises, and example scripts.

### 03-Advanced-JS
- **Status:** Planned
- **Contents:** Here, I will explore advanced JavaScript topics such as ES6 features, asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await), and JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Vue). Detailed notes and practical examples will be included.

### 04-Projects
- **Status:** Planned
- **Contents:** In this section, I will apply what I've learned by working on practical projects. Each project will have its own subfolder with a README explaining the project's objectives and how to run it.

### resources
- **Status:** Ongoing
- **Contents:** A collection of useful resources including books, video tutorials, and links to websites. I will update this section with new resources as I find them.

## Future Plans

- Continue expanding each section with more detailed notes and exercises.
- Complete and add more projects to the `04-Projects` folder.
- Regularly update the `resources` folder with new and useful learning materials.

Happy learning!
